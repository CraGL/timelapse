Modify the paths inside `detect_keyframe.cpp`, compile, and run it.

This code takes as input the color-shifted image sequence output from `s1_whole_sequence_colorshift` (step 1).
It outputs a keyframe sequence, keyframe difference masks, and a new sequence (after performing subsequence color shifts).
