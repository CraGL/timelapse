Compile `layer_extraction.cpp`. You will need to include and link: opencv, json, zlib.
Run `layer_extraction path/to/parameters.json`. In the example `rose_layer_extraction.json`, you may need to modify some paths.

This code uses a clean albedo video or image sequence (resulting from the preprocessing steps). It outputs KM layers or PD layers or both.
