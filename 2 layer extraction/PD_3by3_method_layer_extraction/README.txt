Compile and run `PD_spatial_coherency_3by3_layer_extraction.cpp`. You will need to include and link OpenCV and Eigen. You can change the paths in `main()`.

The code uses a before/after image pair as input. The output is the RGBA paint stroke (`layer.png` which is a combination of `alpha.png` and `paint.png`).
